# Gentics Mesh - Common API

This module contains internal API code which is not graph db specific.

Code from `/core` and `/common` was here since it does not require the `mdm` API.

Tasks: 

* It may be worth to keep the code in a dedicated module. If this is not wanted it could also be moved to `/mdm/common` or `/common`.
