== Apache Reverse Proxy

The `AllowEncodedSlashes` and `nocanon` flag are needed in order to correctly proxy Gentics Mesh requests.

```xml
<VirtualHost *:80 [::]:80>
        ProxyPreserveHost On
        AllowEncodedSlashes On

        ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/ nocanon
        ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
        ServerName mesh
        ServerAlias mesh.*
</VirtualHost>
```

== Nginx Reverse Proxy

The following configuration creates a mesh load balancer / failover setup for Nginx.


```yaml
# Upstream for 4 a four node cluster.
# The localhost:8191 instance will be used
# as a primary server.
upstream mesh {
    server localhost:8191 weight=5;
    server localhost:8192 backup;
    server localhost:8193 backup;
    server localhost:8194 backup;
}

server {
    listen 9099;
    # Body size needs to be increased to support uploads to mesh.
    client_max_body_size 400M;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://mesh;
        # Add needed headers in order to support websockets
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```
