# Gentics Mesh - Ferma

This module contains the patched Ferma library.

## Goals / Background

Before MDM the goal was to replace Ferma with MADL in order to support the Tinkerpop 3 API.

The library was directly added to Mesh in order to gradually phase all library calls out and replace them with MADL API.
